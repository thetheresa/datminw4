downshift braking suggest taking us driver test either 1 learn smoothly takes time practice 2 borrow car automatic take test q often replace brake fluid probably often traditional brake fluids tend absorb water water corrode internal parts brake system also lower boiling point fluid type older fluids newer specifications principal differences wet dry boiling points dry boiling point important fresh brake fluid wet boiling point important older brake fluid fluids lowest wet dry boiling point fluids better boiling point requirements fluids best boiling point requirements fluids clearly

high octane gasoline help maybe maybe cars knock sensors adjust engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline used cars however use cheapest gas makes car run well check owner manual details car

however modern leaded gasolines actually contain little lead however check owner manual many cars early 1970s actually require leaded gasoline q fuel treatments help kind use winter good idea use dry gas however may harmful fuel injection systems never use additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol additives may damage fuel systems cars carbs almost certainly damage cars fuel injection manufacturer opinions vary additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol car fuel injection check manual car using manufacturers consider 10 ethanol acceptable gasoline additives isopropyl alcohol isopropanol petroleum distillates fine fuel injected cars occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful cars fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents job brands fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol methanol always check ingredients putting anything gas tank small number particularly good additives noticeably expensive ones work much much better among chevron techron redline wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber bg 44k bottle one every six months highly recommended q detergent gasolines quality detergent packages gasolines varies somewhat bmw instituted testing program gasoline brands pass test may advertise fact stickers indicating passage test beginning appear fuel pumps gas stations gasolines used fuel injector cleaners probably optional beforewarned use bmw approved gasolines keep clean engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposits lubrication questions q numbers letters motor oil designation mean several different items

great post martin informative humanitarian without neglecting need scientific rigor since personality typing discussed beginning note set followups since comments oriented sure replies responding

4 years end even two weeks ceftin work confirmed diagnoses chronic bacterial infection sinuses via mucus color wo get details symptoms three traditional ent made diagnosis cultures done however difficulty right symptoms clearly showed bacterial infection enough background provided help understand make comments sporanox therapy first question fungus penetrate little way poor mucus membrane

weeks also received zinc supplementation since interrelate fairly complex ways doctor explained one orthomolecular specialists blood test three weeks later vitamin normal stopped vitamin except supplement made sure maintain beta carotene call carrot face hopefully elaine doctor take similar careful approach supplements even reevaluating supplements taking example niacin fairly large dosages 1 steve dyer good information niacin improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergies probably worth taking large dose risking liver damage though believe based successful therapy sporanox definitely excessive growth fungus unknown species sinuses still want ask question studies demonstrate candida blooms sinuses associated sinus irritation sinus irritation reduced significantly one week sporanox new treatments implemented time noticeable gi track problems starting sporanox days went away considered normal btw doctor dug one medical reference books sorry remember one found obscure comment dating back stated people develop contained aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis sinuses leading sinus inflammation symptoms dig reference since relevant discussion doctor tested believe rast rast similar test allergic response specificially candida albicans showed strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive test essentially useless assuming true candida grow mucus membrane tissue concentration exceeds threshold amount could person tests allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptoms mucus membrane irritation due body allergic response said earlier post one need rocket scientist degree biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis btw repost ivker book sinus survival routinely given anything else nizoral systemic safe good sporanox new chronic sinusitis

balanced see posters group comes point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic sporanox exhausted avenues one traditional medical establishment able help natural thing went couple doctor somewhat outside establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapies patients finally reach point accepted therapies ineffective like hear doctor tell well tried therapies approved accepted country since clearly work authority use experimental unproven techniques seem helped others ca promise anything risks sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapies register case state board anyway ent suggested would jumped pronto instead going one doctors either altruistic reasons greed practicing alternative therapies much risk risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable data would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system showing compassion medical community patient
